# The Valutico App

This webpage was built using React + Vite Framework.
It was developed with reference to a Figma design which can be found here [here](https://www.figma.com/design/lkNm0iNJONhsObqVIbfVRy/Vaultico?node-id=0-1&t=Ez56E3vYeTapNyAh-0)

This project was also hosted on Vercel and can be viewed [here](https://valutico-react-app.vercel.app/)

## Improvements
Note: This page is yet to be made responsive for all devices. This is a futuristic plan. Also, other pages for the webpage will be included.

## Using the app
To use the project or work on it, you can fork the repository and clone it to your machine.

### Best Regards 👍🏽👍🏽
